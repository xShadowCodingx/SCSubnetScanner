# DISCLAIMER
This is a work in progress, while it works on my end don't guarantee anything on anyone elses. I claim no liability for the use of this program by anyone else. Use at your own risk.

This program utilizes multiple threads, which could cause issues for resource constrained systems.

## How to use:
- Type in the subnet that you want (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24)
- Then it will go to work logged all connected devices
- After it scans (using multi-thread for speed), it creates a .xlsv file for Excel
- This file will generate on the desktop of the user running the program

## Future Features:
- Better bug handling
- Run optimization
